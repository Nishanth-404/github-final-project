Note
----

Please note that Zipline is not a community-led project. Zipline is maintained by the Quantopian engineering team, and we are quite small and often busy. Because of this, we want to warn you that we may not attend to your pull request, issue, or direct mention in months, or even years. We hope you understand, and we hope that this note might help reduce any frustration or wasted time. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
